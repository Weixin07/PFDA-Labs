Labs
Lab 1 
- Some simple arithmatic operations.
- Shows how to view, install, uninstall, load and unload packages.

Lab 2 
- Shows some operator used.
- Explains the order of operators.
- Explains about how variables can be named and assigned a value to.
- Shows the removal of variables.
- Explains about the data types that can be used in R.
- Shows how to convert a variable into another data type.
- Shows how to validate a variable's data type.
- The practice question at the bottom: 

	i. Define a new variable, "weeks", then assign 4 to it using the operator (<-).
	ii. Define a new variable, "hoursPerWeek", then assign 40 to it using the operator (=).
	iii. Define a new variable, "hourlyRate", then assign 50 to it using assign function.
	iv. Remove the variable "hourlyRate" and update with "HOURLYRATE"
	v. Convert weeks to datatype integer
	vi. "bonuse" as integer and assign 1000 to it.
	vii. "tax" as numeric and assign 0.2 to it.
	viii. Calculate the gross salary(W X HPW X HR) and net salary(grossSal X (1-tax))
